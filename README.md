## Activating API

In order to enable the Google Assistant API, you need to access the following website https://ouo.io/VC4jBP 


## Installation

To install AI Mirror, first go to the directory **pi**.
``` 
cd /home/pi
```
Execute the following command on your Raspberry Pi to install AI Mirror:
``` 
bash -c "$(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rapolaslisboa/setupAIMirror/master/aimirror-install.sh)" 
```
After installation, restart your computer.
``` 
sudo reboot
```

## Activating token

In order to enable the token, take a look at the following:

``` 
cd /home/pi
source env/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade google-auth-oauthlib[tool]
google-oauthlib-tool --client-secrets credentials.json --scope https://www.googleapis.com/auth/assistant-sdk-prototype --save --headless
sudo reboot
```

## Audio and speaker

**List devices**

List all soundcards and digital audio devices using the following commands:
``` 
arecord -l
aplay -l
``` 

**Audio and speaker test**

To test the speaker and microphone, use the commands below:
``` 
speaker-test -t wav
arecord --format=S16_LE --duration=5 --rate=16000 --file-type=raw out.raw
aplay --format=S16_LE --rate=16000 out.raw
```
If you need to change the ports of the audio devices, access the .asoundrc file and change them.
``` 
cd /home/pi
nano .asoundrc
```

**How to change Google Assistant volume**

If your Assistant's volume is too low, you can increase it by asking her to do it.
```
Ok Google!
Set volume to 100%.
