AI Mirror is a project that uses the smart mirror technique and is based on the MagicMirror project to develop an interactive mirror with Google Assistant integration. The project was made by the students RÃ¡polas Lisboa and Ricardo Zaponi. Further information about MagicMirror at https://magicmirror.builders/.

## Activating API

* In order to enable the Google Assistant API, you need to access the following website https://ouo.io/VC4jBP 


## Installation

To install AI Mirror, first go to the directory **pi**.
``` 
cd /home/pi
```
Execute the following command on your Raspberry Pi to install AI Mirror:
``` 
bash -c "$(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rapolaslisboa/setupAIMirror/master/aimirror-install.sh)" 
```

## Activating token

In order to enable the token, take a look at the following:

``` 
source env/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade google-auth-oauthlib[tool]
google-oauthlib-tool --client-secrets credentials.json --scope https://www.googleapis.com/auth/assistant-sdk-prototype --save --headless
sudo reboot
```

## Audio and speaker

**List devices**

List all soundcards and digital audio devices using the following commands:
``` 
arecord -l
aplay -l
``` 

**Audio and speaker test**

To test the speaker and microphone, use the commands below:
``` 
speaker-test -t wav
arecord --format=S16_LE --duration=5 --rate=16000 --file-type=raw out.raw
aplay --format=S16_LE --rate=16000 out.raw
```
If you need to change the ports of the audio devices, access the .asoundrc file and change them.
``` 
cd /home/pi
nano .asoundrc
```
